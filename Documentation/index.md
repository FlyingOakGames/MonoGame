Welcome to the MonoGame documentation hub!

MonoGame is a simple and powerful .NET framework for creating games for desktop PCs, video game consoles, and mobile devices.

Based on [Microsoft's XNA Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb200104.aspx), it provides the following features:

- Game framework
- 2D and 3D rendering
- Sound effect and music playback
- Keyboard, mouse, touch, and controller inputs
- Content building and optimization
- Math library optimized for games

This documentation helps you get started, providing overviews of key features and tools and a complete API reference.

Please use the links at the top and left to navigate the documentation sections.

## What is MonoGame exactly?

MonoGame is a "bring your own tools" kind of framework, which means that it provides the building blocks to build your own engine and tools, but it isn't quite an engine itself.

If you are expecting a scene editor (like Unity), MonoGame is not that.

If you love coding and having a control over you game logic, MonoGame might be your jam.

## We Need Your Help!

Great open source projects require high-quality documentation.  This is a call for volunteers to continue to help us make the MonoGame documentation truly great.  If you can create tutorials, feature guides, code snippets, reference docs, or video walkthroughs, or make any improvement to our current documentation, we could use your help!

Check out the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame/blob/develop/README.md) or [talk with us on the community site](http://community.monogame.net/t/lets-improve-the-monogame-documentation/916) to learn how to help!
